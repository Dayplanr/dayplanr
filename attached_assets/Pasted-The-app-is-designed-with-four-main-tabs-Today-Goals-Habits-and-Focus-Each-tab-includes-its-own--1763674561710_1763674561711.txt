The app is designed with four main tabs: Today, Goals, Habits, and Focus. Each tab includes its own integrated analytics so users don’t need an extra “Insights” section. Instead, every category provides personalized progress data directly within its page.

Today (Dashboard) gives users a clear overview of their day. They can scroll forward or backward to prepare for tomorrow or review previous days. Tasks can include timers, reminders, and exact times (like 8:30). Users can also group tasks by time categories such as Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night. Repeating daily task lists can be fixed across multiple days to avoid unnecessary retyping. Completed tasks can be undone, and tasks can be sorted by priority (high / medium / low) or by time order. The Today page also integrates key insights such as daily completion rate, focus time, streaks, and top completed tasks. Daily habits can be collapsed for a cleaner layout. Categories like groceries or study can be personalized. Colors for the page can be user-selected.

Goals focuses on long-term vision while integrating the daily milestones into Today. The page displays progress by category, key tasks for each goal, and projected completion time. Trends such as weekly progress (upward / stable / downward) and milestones hit during the week appear automatically. Users can choose the color theme for the Goals page as well.

Habits helps users build consistency with time-based reminders (optional timers). It tracks streaks, weekly and monthly consistency, and success rates. A soft heatmap visualizes habit performance using gentle peach/beige tones. Users can join shared habit challenges with friends, such as 21-day challenges, and choose their preferred color theme for the Habits page.

Focus is built for deep-work planning using Pomodoro blocks, distraction tracking, and automatic break detection. It shows daily, weekly, and monthly focus minutes, average session length, distraction count, and the user’s best focus times based on behavioral patterns. All of these insights are integrated directly into the Focus page. Users can assign their preferred color theme here too.

The app supports English, German, and as many languages as possible. Users can personalize color palettes for each tab (e.g., soft blue, peach, mint green, pastel tones), ensuring motivation and aesthetic harmony throughout the experience.
